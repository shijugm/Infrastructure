Setting up a multi-node Kafka cluster setup.

We must ensure that the service names and KAFKA_BROKER_ID are unique across the services.

Moreover, each service must expose a unique port to the host machine. Although zookeeper-1 and zookeeper-2 are listening on port 2181, they're exposing it to the host via ports 22181 and 32181, respectively. The same logic applies for the kafka-1 and kafka-2 services, where they'll be listening on ports 29092 and 39092, respectively.
